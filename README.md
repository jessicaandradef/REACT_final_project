# React Final Project

## Project Overview

This React project is titled **"Movies & Popcorn"**, it's a movie catalog that utilizes an [API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to display information about various movies. The project was created to complete the React module in the FullStack Web Development course and to enhance my web development skills using React. It's also an opportunity to share my passion for movies with other users who can access the project.

**_The project consists of three main features:_**

#### 1. Home Page - Movie Catalog:

On this page, users can browse and search for a wide variety of movies. When searching for a movie in the search bar, the results will be filtered based on the entered keyword and the movies will be displayed succinctly. Detailed information about each movie, such as title, synopsis, release date, genre, cast, director, and rating, will be available after clicking on a specific movie. 🎬📽️📺

#### 2. Profile Page:

The profile page allows users to access the developer's profile. It contains a brief description of myself, a little about my journey and my skills. 👩🏼‍💻💁🏼‍♀️

#### 3. Contact Form:

The contact form allows users to get in touch with the project's developer to ask questions, report issues or provide suggestions. Users can enter their name, email address, and message in the form, and the messages will be sent directly to my email. Feel free to contact me, I'll be delighted to respond 😁✨

## Technologies Used

- **React:** JavaScript library used to build the project's user interface.
- **Vite:** The build tool used for project initialization and development.
- **Movie API:** The data source for obtaining information about the movies in the catalog.
- **HTML and CSS:** Used for the structure and styling of the page (CSS modules).
- **React Router:** Used for navigation between different pages of the project.
- **Custom Hooks:** `useMovies` - simplifies the process of making API calls to fetch movie data based on the provided search query and handles the state management for storing and updating movie information.

## Instructions for Running the Project Locally

If you want to run the project on your own machine, follow these steps:

- Clone the project repository.
- Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
- Run the command `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Next, run the command `npm run dev` to start the development server.
- Access the application in your browser using the address http://localhost:5173.

## Final Thoughts

The React Final Project - **Movies & Popcorn** was an excellent opportunity to dive into web development with React and apply the concepts learned throughout the course. My passion for movies was a significant motivation to create this project, and I hope it proves useful to other movie enthusiasts and web developers as well. Enjoy it! 🤩
